# Quizlet Frontend Interview Question

## What's this for?

For your upcoming interview, we'll ask you to build a single-page web app that won't have to deal with API calls or routing. We believe in setting up candidates for success, so we want to help you get set up with the tools you're most comfortable with.

You're welcome to use the framework, language, and build process you're most familiar with, though we highly recommend using a common framework like React, Angular, or Vue. You can also use jQuery or [vanilla Javascript](http://vanilla-js.com/). You're also encouraged to use other libraries you prefer e.g., Redux, Immutable.js, MobX, Flow, Typescript, etc.

## Your options:

1. Start with one of the two provided subfolders,  `react-js` or `vanilla-js`. These are starting examples that you can use and build on top of.
2. Use a boilerplate like [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app), [angular-seed](https://github.com/angular/angular-seed), or [vue-webpack-boilerplate](https://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack).
3. Set up your own environment (Elm, Reason, ClojureScript... whatever you desire!)

**Bottom line**: We want you to be successful, so please pick the option that you feel most at-ease with.

**Questions**? We're happy to help. Just email your recruiter and we'll get back to you.
